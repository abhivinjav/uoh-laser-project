# uoh-laser-project
files, code and stuff for my UoH laser work

## What is it about?
This is a repository of all the files I used in my project, including but not limited to: images and data recorded, codes, plots, reports.

## The files and folders
- **image_analysis_csv_files**: self-explanatory.
- **raw_images**: the images captured on the ccd.
  - The final shadowgraphy data without the crosshairs has the reference images for all three positions, the gifs for 16 captures with the aerosol at all three positions, and the 16 jpegs for at and after the focal plane positions.
  - The spot size data has the photos for spot size at different positions without the aerosol, and at two positions with 16 captures each for with the aerosol (water).
- **spectrum**: Has the spectrum data, spectrum plots, and the code for the spectrum plots.
- `radial_intensity_profile.py`: The code for the radial intensity profiles. The plots are saved to **radial_profiles**.
- `full_intensity_profile.py`: The code for graphs with intensity profile from -r to +r. Plots saved to **full_radial_profiles**.
